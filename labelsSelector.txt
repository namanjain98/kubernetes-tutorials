we can create as many labels as we want 
to select the pod with labels
    kubectl get pods --selector app=App1
labels and selector are use to connect different objects

Annotations:-
    Use to record other details for infomatry purpose
        Ex: phone no,email-id,build number etc

To execute the command inside the pod 
kubectl -n elastic-stack exec -it app -- cat /log/app.log
