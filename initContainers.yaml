#But at times you may want to run a process that runs to completion in a container.
#For example a process that pulls a code or binary from a repository that will be used by the main web application.
# That is a task that will be run only  one time when the pod is first created. 
#Or a process that waits  for an external service or database to be up before the actual application starts.
#That's where initContainers comes in.

#You can configure multiple such initContainers as well, like how we did for multi-pod containers.
# In that case each init container is run one at a time in sequential order.
